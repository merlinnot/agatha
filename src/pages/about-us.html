          ## Marcin
          I am a professional, licenced tour guide in Wrocław and the Sudety mountains. This is something I have always loved to do.
          My guiding career started as a hobby. I organized and guided my first trips for my classmates in secondary school. During my studies in Wrocław I passed all the required exams and became a mountain guide. After studies I had a break in guiding because I got married and started to work for American companies. This period lasted a few years, but helped me a lot to improve my English skills and now I am able to guide also in the English language.

          The great advantage of guiding in the region where I live, is a huge variety of interesting places and intriguing stories behind them. My other long-lasting fascination is History, and there are few places where history has had so many twists and turns, so many ups and downs, as in the Lower Silesia region. A marvel for history creeps! ;-) Guiding in such fascinating and beautiful places as we have in Lower Silesia is a great pleasure for me and I am sure you will also fall in love with our region, a love at first sight! I am looking forward to showing it to you!

          ## Agata
          I have always been one of those people who are fascinated with too many things for their own good! Music, film, history of Art, architecture, photography, travelling, gardening, cuisine, literature, sociology… - you name it! I graduated from the University of Wrocław, the Department of English Philology and was quite happy with my job of a translator until I realised that what I really wanted was to work with people! The following years found me teaching English… At some point I noticed though, with a slight surprise, that I am always somewhere else with my students, instead of the classroom! Dragging them across Europe, or through our own region - caves and mountains, castles and museums, Christmas fairs and art workshops… I did the same with my family, my friends, neighbours, colleagues… And they loved it!

          So, naturally, inevitably - here I am, in the right place! 
          Guiding lets me combine all my passions and talents in one. And have good fun at work. And makes me search, and learn, and develop all the time.
          Ok, I’ll be honest - the dangers are: I’ll laugh too much, talk too much, too easily get involved in heated discussions, will want to show you too much and probably will be overprotective… You’ve been warned! ;-)

          ## Agata about Marcin
          I have known Marcin since secondary school, we were classmates and “tripmates” :-). 
          We met again a few years ago, when I started learning to become a tour guide and Marcin was there for me to share his knowledge and experience. 
          His knowledge and passion for history will never cease to amaze me. And I’m not talking of just dates, names and facts. Marcin can make all these past events seem so vivid, so meaningful, even for us today… 
          You will also love his sense of humour, his energy and certainly appreciate his experience and skills as a tour guide and travel guide. He’s a master of organisation! Also, he has a knack for detective work, which has proven helpful on numerous occasions. Last but not least, he has the third eye as far as delicious food is concerned!

          ## Marcin about Agata
          Agata is probably the most cheerful and friendly person I know. Her attitude to life is so enthusiastic that I am sure she is able to overcome literally every problem she encounters. As we have known each other since secondary school I had enough time to get to know her quite well and I must admit that I have always admired her positive influence on other people. It is simply impossible not to be in high spirits with her!
          
          Agata is very caring about other people no matter if they are family members or somebody she has just met. It is always appreciated by the tourists who prefer moving slower and get a deep feel of the city. This advantage of her as a guide is even reflected in our brand name: SLower Silesia, which was, of course, invented by Agata.
          As Agata is a professional English teacher, her deep knowledge of language idioms and curiosities always impresses me. The stories of our region she tells in English are very lively and fascinating. Do not miss it!
