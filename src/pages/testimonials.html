          **Testimonials**

          Adam, New York/Wrocław (school exchange): *I was with Mrs Agata in San
          Sebastian for a week. What I enjoyed most was the fact that she put
          emphasis on exploring the city, way past the typical tourist spots.
          We not only saw the famous part of the Basque city but the equally
          beautiful "hidden" streets that the locals use.*

          the Nickels family (genealogy tour): *Our experienced Polish guide
          from Wrocław, Marcin, is fluent in English and Polish. He made 
          arrangements with the parish priests before our visit.*

          John C., (pilgrimage to Italy): *I am very grateful to you for your
          thoughtfulness. I did  enjoy listening to you. You were very good as
          our tour guide.*

          Dawid, Adam, Łukasz (school trip to Dresden): *It was the best trip
          ever! With you even the museums were fascinating! ;-) Thanks for
          advice as to the Christmas fair specialities and souvenirs for
          family.*
